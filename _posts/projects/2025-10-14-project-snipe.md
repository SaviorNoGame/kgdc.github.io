<!-- ## Description

## Game Design -->

## Development Timeline
Week 8
- Implementing Win Conditions: When the player kills the target NPC, the game ends, showing an end-screen. This also occurs when the timer ends.
- Learning to use Tileset & TileMapLayer. We'll use this to design the map. 
- Implementing art assets into the game.

Week 9
- Creating the final version of the map.
- Adding NPC pathfinding & implementing it into the map.
- Adding visual and mechanical differientation among NPCs.

Week 10
- Adding scope control: When the player holds the right mouse button, they will use the sniper's scope, steading their crosshair and greatly zooming in, making it hard to see the overall map.
- Adding a timer that will end the game once it times out.
- Wrapping up the prototype; creating a stable build of the game to post online for people to play.
- Determining whether we want to continue the project next term (Winter 2026), or to start a new prototype/project.
